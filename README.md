# What is this?

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts related to my edits of Nigerian-related articles on Wikipedia.

# File descriptions

* `archive.ipynb` - Notebook transforming an archived version of Nigeria Congress Online into a CSV file. This file can be turned into a table in Wikipedia for [List of members of the House of Representatives of Nigeria, 1999-2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_House_of_Representatives_of_Nigeria,_1999%E2%80%932003).
* `glue.ipynb` - Notebook to assemble each House and Senate term into one large spreadsheet.
* `main.ipynb` - Notebook testing OpenCV and PyTesseract functionalities.
* `main.py` - Python script to take scans of [Nigeria Legislature 1861-2011: A Compendium of Members & Officials](https://search.worldcat.org/title/nigeria-legislature-1861-2011-a-compendium-of-members-officials-a-special-publication-in-commemoration-of-nigeria-at-50/oclc/936080088) into CSV files.
* `merge.ipynb` - Notebook to help merging information in the CSV files generated by `main.py` into the tables already created on Wikipedia.

# Set up `main.py`

To run `main.py`, use these commands to set up environment:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change the `DIR_NAME` to the folder with scans you want to start creating spreadsheets.

Run the main Python file to start creating the spreadsheets:

```
python ./src/main.py
```

This code is not perfect and contains inconveniences. However, they are manageable and don't waste *too* much time. If you make a mistake, you may need to redo some minute's worth of work or correct it after the CSV is written.
